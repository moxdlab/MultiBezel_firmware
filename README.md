**MultiBezel: Adding Multi-Touch to a Smartwatch Bezel to Control Music**

Limited screen space and reliance on touch input pose challenges for intuitive interaction on smartwatches, often leading to screen
occlusion and hindered usability. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents MultiBezel, a novel multi-touch enabled bezel
designed to enhance interaction on smartwatches. MultiBezel utilises a gesture-based interaction scheme, mapping distinct finger
combinations to control the smartwatch. This approach shifts interaction away from the touchscreen enabling new ways of eyes-free
control. We developed a functional prototype that recognises up to three simultaneous touch points. This prototype demonstrates the
feasibility of multi-touch bezel interaction for enhancing the smartwatch user experience. We contribute the hardware and software of
our prototype and implemented an application for music control.
